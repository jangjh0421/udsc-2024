    "Dot maps showing demographic and household data, like the one above, are often based on census data. Census data are usually publicly available pre-aggregated to spatial boundaries. In Canada, for instance, urban maps are often created using neighbourhood Census Tracts or smaller Dissemination Area boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dots on demographic dot maps, like those shown above, are therefore not perfect representations of where people live; they are estimated. For example, in the map above, if we know that there are 100 households in subsidized housing in a neighbourhood, we generate 10 dots <b><u>randomly placed within that neighbourhood</u></b>. If we have available data, this process can be improved via [dasymetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasymetric_map) mapping,  where we only place dots in locations where we think people live. For example, in the above map, we used a land-use layer to place dots only in residential zones rather than parks or industrial zones. Once we have this working for one neighbourhood, it is then repeated for all neighbourhoods and all categories we want to include on our map.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we're going to cover how to create dot maps like these using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [geoPandas](https://geopandas.org/), and some final cartography in [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). The example data will be used to replicate the map above, but the methods and code can be applied to anywhere with similar data."

For example, if there are 200 households in a DA, and the rate is 10 households per dot, then we would generate 20 dots in the DA.\n",

This may vary depending on the intended size of your map as well as the spatial distribution of what you're trying to map. Deciding on a dot rate often requires some iteration in generating the dots, looking at the output on a map, and then re-generating them if need be. (I initially started with `d = 20`, but decided to reduce since I thought the map was too sparse)."

If you want to dig into the patterns of each specifically, i.e. are less concerned about the comparisons, or are only interested in density OR proportions (rather than both at the same time), a series of individual choropleth or single-category dot density maps would be good to pursue as well. It's rare to have too many maps :)"
